					<center>ABOUT US</center>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<center><img src="images/preventio.png" alt="MyDaty" class="responsive-logo"></center>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Preventio Indonesia</strong> is a startup focused on
					developing advanced information technology-based healthcare products. Preventio Indonesia was
					founded by <a href="index.html#one">Margareth S. C. Simandjuntak (CEO), Bernand J. H. Simatupang
						(CFO), Pray P. H. Nadeak (CTO), and Fajar M. Y. Zain (CMO)</a> in 2025 in Bandung City.
					Preventio Indonesia was created to address the challenge of providing smart preventive healthcare at
					an affordable price, tackling the pressing issue of cardiac health in Indonesia.</p>
					<p>Indonesia faces a cardiac health emergency. Heart attack cases are a top killer, with 20 million
					cases reported in 2023,
					marking a significant increase of 29.31%. The national health insurance (JKN) spending on these
					cases reached a staggering
					RP 150 billion in 2023, a 61.04% increase. This is exacerbated by a limited number of
					cardiologists—only 1,587 for a population
					of over 286 million people—a figure that is below the WHO standard.</p>
					<p>To address this, we provide a solution called <strong>ModiChain</strong>, <em>a mobile detection
					platform based on AI & Blockchain.</em>
					The system works by analyzing a smartphone camera's video stream and user-provided information from
					a screening questionnaire. This data is then processed by a predictive AI/ML model to deliver
					real-time,
					highly accurate health insights. ModiChain offers a range of benefits, including 95% accuracy,
					real-time and
					interactive results, multi-platform and user-friendly design, and safe & secure data handling. Our
					platform also
					integrates blockchain for data security, provides incentive rewards, and facilitates crowdfunding,
					all while ensuring a participative user experience.</p>
					<p>We recognize the significant opportunity presented by the growing digital market in Indonesia. The
					number of cryptocurrency investors has increased significantly, with 22.1 million users in 2024, up
					from 11.2 million in 2021. Additionally, the percentage of smartphone users in Indonesia has
					consistently risen year by year, with figures reaching over 69% in 2024. We believe we must take
					this opportunity, now or never!</p>

				<br>

				<!------------------------------------------VISION AND MISSION----------------------------------------------------->

				<strong>Vision: </strong>
				<br>
				<em>Providing the most trusted AI & blockchain-based global digital healthcare ecosystem, enabling early
					detection of various diseases and providing more inclusive and secure access to healthcare.</em>
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Mission: </strong>
				<br>
				1. Developing trusted AI solutions for reading health indicators from visual and biometric
				data.
				<br>
				2. Building a blockchain ecosystem to ensure the security, privacy, and integrity of medical
				data.
				<br>
				3. Integrating tokenization ($PEVIO) to encourage engagement, incentives, and ecosystem
				sustainability.
				<br>
				4. Educating the public to be more aware of preventive health through easily accessible
				technology.
				<br>
				5. Collaborating with medical professionals, healthcare institutions, and regulators to
				maintain validity and compliance.

				<strong>
					<center>CORE VALUES</center>
				</strong>
				<br>
				<div class="features5">
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/1.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This value is our commitment to prioritizing research and leveraging the latest
							technological solutions. We manifest this value in the development of our core
							technology: the use of AI for visual health analysis via a simple smartphone camera.
							This approach strategically avoids the barriers of expensive and inaccessible hardware,
							making advanced health screening available to millions of people. This value is also
							evident in our adoption of blockchain technology for data management and incentive
							structures, which positions us as a technology pioneer in the healthcare sector. Our
							future product pipeline—as outlined in our company roadmap—is proof of our ongoing
							commitment to innovation.</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/2.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This is our core philosophy: to act proactively and empower individuals before it's
							too late, rather than simply reacting to disease. This value is a direct response to
							Indonesia's cardiac health crisis, where the historical focus has been on expensive
							treatments. Our flagship product, ModiChain, is an early detection tool, not a
							treatment. Its purpose is to provide early, actionable insights that allow users to make
							healthier lifestyle choices and seek professional help before a condition becomes
							critical.</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/3.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This value is built on a foundation of trust through transparency, with blockchain
							technology serving as the cornerstone for the security and integrity of sensitive
							medical data. This is our strongest differentiator. In an era where data breaches are
							common, we leverage blockchain to provide a secure, immutable ledger for medical
							records. This not only protects user privacy but also creates a transparent and
							verifiable system, which is a crucial factor in earning the trust of both B2C users and
							B2B partners</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/4.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This value reflects our belief that digital health solutions should be easily
							accessible to all segments of society. It is embodied in our strategic decision to build
							our core technology around the smartphone camera, leveraging Indonesia's high smartphone
							penetration rate. This approach removes the expensive hardware barrier, making advanced
							health screening available to millions of people. Our business model, which includes a
							"Free" tier, further reinforces this commitment by enabling anyone with a smartphone to
							begin their preventive health journey.</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/5.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This value is rooted in our belief that true progress in healthcare requires synergy
							with medical professionals, hospitals, and the broader community. We operate based on a
							"Branded House" architecture designed to facilitate collaboration. We view potential
							competitors, such as wearable device companies (Apple, Samsung), not as threats, but as
							data input partners for our PreventIO Connect product. Our B2B business model (MAX
							version) and the PreventIO Care product line are built specifically to integrate with
							and serve traditional healthcare institutions and health insurance providers, creating a
							seamless patient flow from detection to treatment.</p>
						<br>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/corevalue/6.png" alt="Logo Preventio" style="height:400px;">
						<br>
						<p>This value is our long-term vision to build a self-sustaining health ecosystem, with
							tokenization as a key driver. Our business model and roadmap are built for long-term
							viability. The integration of the $PEVIO crypto token is a strategic innovation that
							drives engagement and loyalty. By rewarding healthy behavior with tokens, we create a
							powerful, gamified incentive loop that encourages repeat use and long-term
							participation. This model provides us with a new, sustainable revenue stream and a
							unique way to build a loyal user base, ensuring the ecosystem's longevity for years to
							come.</p>
